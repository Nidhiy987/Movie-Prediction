## Project Overview
This project examines how language, production country, genre, and budget influence the ratings of movies. Using a dataset that includes attributes like budget, popularity, revenue, runtime, vote average, and original language, the analysis explores the relationship between these factors and movie ratings, providing insights into the commercial viability and artistic appeal of films.

## Background and Motivation
Film combines artistic expression with commercial enterprise. Understanding the factors that affect movie ratings is crucial for filmmakers and studios to make informed decisions about film production and marketing. This project aims to dissect these influences in a structured manner using statistical analysis.

## Methodology
- **Data Source**: Movie ratings and attributes are sourced from a comprehensive dataset available on Kaggle. 
- **Tools Used**: Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas are utilized for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Analytical Approach**:
  - Descriptive statistics to understand the distribution and central tendencies of the data.
  - Visualizations to identify patterns and relationships between variables.
  - Probabilistic analysis to quantify the likelihood of certain outcomes based on budget and popularity thresholds.

## Repository Structure
- `CMSE201_FinalProject.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
  
## Conclusion
The analysis indicates that while financial investment in a film through its budget can enhance its production quality, it does not guarantee higher ratings or popularity. Factors such as genre and original language play significant roles in shaping a film's reception.

## Future Work
Further analysis could involve more granular data regarding viewer demographics to better understand the audience's preferences and how they correlate with movie ratings.
